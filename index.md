### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was among one of my favorite labs in this class. I found it interesting how we had to utilize the photos to get the correct times and figure out how the times relate to eachother. I'll admit that I messed up a few times when working on this one, although I still think that needing to get the information from the photos was a cool idea.

* Lab 6

    I enjoyed lab 6. The introduction to vectors had me confused at first, but this lab was a good way of introducing it, and it was in a pretty fun way too. Making us separate the vectors into sandwich ingredients was a fun way to describe vectors.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was a difficult lab, and I did struggle with this one quite a bit. Although I do believe this one was extremely helpful for the rest of the labs, and I also think the spelling check was a pretty cool project.
